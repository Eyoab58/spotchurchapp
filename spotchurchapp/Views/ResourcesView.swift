        " I Cross My Face \n\n I cross my face and all of myself by the sign of the cross. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; One God. In the Holy Trinity believing and entrusting myself, I deny you satan in front of my mother the Holy Church, who is my witness, St. Mary Tsion forever. Amen We thank you O Lord, and we glorify you, we praise you O Lord, and we rely on you, we beg you and we beseech you. We worship you and we serve to your Holy name. We bow and kneel down to you; O you to whom all knees should bow and who all tongues serve. You are the God of gods and the Lord of lords and the King of kings. You are God to all flesh and to all souls, and we call you as your Holy Son taught us saying 'But when you pray you shall say",
        
        " Thanksgiving Prayer (St. Basil)\n\nLet us give thanks to the beneficent and merciful God, the Father of our Lord, God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for He has covered us, helped us, guarded us, accepted us unto Him, spared us, supported us, and brought us to this hour. Let us also ask Him, the Lord our God, the Almighty, to guard us in all peace this holy day and all the days of our life. O Master, Lord, God the Almighty, the Father of our Lord, God and Savior, Jesus Christ, we thank You for every condition, concerning every condition, and in every condition, for You have covered us, helped us, guarded us, accepted us unto You, spared us, supported us, and brought us to this hour. Therefore, we ask and entreat Your goodness, O Lover of mankind, to grant us to complete this holy day, and all the days of our life, in all peace with Your fear. All envy, all temptation, all the work of Satan, the counsel of wicked men, and the rising up of enemies, hidden and manifest, take them away from us, and from all Your people, and from this holy place that is Yours. But those things which are good and profitable do provide for us; for it is You Who have given us the authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, by the grace, compassion and love of mankind, of Your Only-Begotten Son, our Lord, God and Savior, Jesus Christ, through Whom the glory, the honor, the dominion, and the adoration are due unto You, with Him, and the Holy Spirit, the Life-Giver, Who is of one essence with You, now and at all times, and unto the ages of all ages. Amen.",
        
        " The Lord’s Prayer\n\n Our father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in Heaven: give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation but deliver us and rescue us from all evil for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever. Amen. ",
        
        " Prayer to St. Mary\n\n By the salutation of Saint Angel Gabriel, O! my Lady Mary I salute you. You are virgin in thought, and Virgin in body, the mother of God Tsabaot (The Lord of Host) salutation to you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Rejoice you who are joyful, O! full of grace, God is with you. Beseech and pray for our mercy to your beloved Son Jesus Christ that He may forgive us our sins. Amen",
        
        " The Creed\n\n We believe in one God, God the Father, the Almighty, who created heaven and earth, and all things seen and unseen. We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages; Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten not created, of one essence with the Father, by whom all things were made; Who for us men and our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary, and became Man. And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, suffered, died, and was buried. And on the third day He rose from the dead, according to the scriptures, ascended into the heavens; He sits at the right hand of His Father, and He  is coming again in His glory to judge the living and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end. Yes, we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Life-Giver, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets. And in one holy, catholic and apostolic church. We confess one baptism for the remission of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the coming age. Amen.",
        
        " The Exaltation of Virgin Mary\n\n My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior, For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant; For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed. For He who is mighty have done great things for me, And holy is His name. And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation. He has shown strength with His arm; He has scattered the proud in the Imagination of their hearts. He has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly, He has filled the hungry with good things, And the rich He has sent away empty. He has helped His servant Israel, In remembrance of His mercy, as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.”",
        
        " Trisagion\n\n Holy God, holy Mighty, holy Living Immortal, who was born from the holy Virgin Mary have mercy upon us all. Holy God, holy Mighty, holy Living Immortal, who was baptized in Jordan and crucified on the tree of the Cross; have mercy upon us all. Holy God, holy Mighty, holy Living Immortal, who rose from the dead on the third day, who ascended to heaven in glory, sat at the right hand of the Father and will come in glory to judge the living and the dead; have mercy upon us all. Glory be to the Father, Glory be to the Son, Glory be to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever; and unto the ages of all ages. Amen"

        "Prayer of Faith\n\n O! God of Israel, My Savior whom you truly reveal yourself for penitents and hides from the proud, I need your presence in my life now more than ever. You have been my shore when I was in storm. You have been my rest in the past when I astray and wonder away from you. You were the true quencher of my thirst in life. But that seems to be all far gone now. Now why do I feel that I am all abandoned? Why don’t I feel the presence and love of my Savior? Why do I feel I am distant from you my Father? I know it’s because I allowed sin to cover the sight of my inner soul. I permitted my guilt to hinder Your work of grace. Now the devil wants me to lose faith not only in You but in myself. But You my anchor, please remind myself that You love me for Your name sake. Give me faith to realize that You welcomed me because I am Your child bought by Your blood. I pray that the Holy Spirit to tell my wretched soul that she is worthy of Your grace. My unlimited sin even won’t reach to the scale of love that You have for my soul. My Father, tell this broken soul to have faith and patience that one day she sees the utmost love You have for her. How You like her. How You adore her. How You would give up anything for her even the ninety nines that you have. Tell that from the filth of sin You would enjoy to clean and wash her. With cloth of mercy You would delight to comfort her. Tell her that you would nourish her with not only perishable food but Your everlasting body. Like a lamp that almost depleted its oil my faith is fainting. If I have faith like the mustard seed I would’ve moved the mountain of unbelief from my life. But Lord as the sick child’s father on Mark 9:24 said, “Help my unbelief”. Help my unbelief in Your deliverance and help me to have faith that I still am loved by You. . In Christ Jesus our Lord name, with the intercession of Your Mother Holy Virgin Mary, with the prayer of Angeles, saints, martyrs and the righteous, Amen.",
                          
        "Prayer of Strength\n\n My Heavenly Father and my Lord I failed in front of Your Holy eyes. You created me in a way that You created no other creatures. Your hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments (Psalm 119) but I failed. Even after You come to save me in flesh I failed You. After You grant me everything I wished in life, I again failed. I failed to see You but You crafted eyes on me; I failed to hear Your voice though Your Holy hands made my ears. I failed to welcome You in my heart and soul yet you breathed that soul within me. Every morning though You eagerly wait of my return and every night You hope for my repentance. But because of this corrupted filthy flesh I ignore you. Saint Paul asked the Galatians who bewitched them not to see who He evidently set forth, crucified among them (Gal 3). I am far worse than them for I see your miraculous works in me but still ignore them. Please Father give me strength to take of the blindfold of distraction from my eyes to see you. I am like that Canaanite women who implored you to heal her daughter in Matthew 15:22. I beg of Your crumb of forgiveness which I am evidently not worthy of. Don’t ignore Your surrendered child. There is no other who will pick me up from my darkest pit. I am sick like the one who was paralyzed and was on bed for 38 years. Let Your words strength my joints so I can get up from the bed of sin. Give me strength so that I don’t lose hope. The devil is telling me that I am an abandoned child; he is whispering on my ears that my sins made me unacceptable in front of Your eyes. Yes I am a sinner who betrayed my Father but give me strength that I believe that You never left me. I made your temple a den of thieves. Give me strength to cast out the sins that corrupted my flesh so that you will dwell in me.",

        "Prayers for Sacrament of Confession\n\n O holy Father, Who longs for the sinners' return and Who promised to accept those who repent, look at a soul that was long lost in the valleys of disobedience. I have long tasted the bitterness of misery, being away from the source of salvation. Now I come back to You to be purified, accept me and do not reject me, for when You look at me with mercy and compassion, I will be cleansed and saved, but if You turn away from me I will perish. Grant me, O Lord, Your blessings to strengthen my will to come closer to You in faith and hope, to confess my sins and detest returning to them. Let Your Holy Spirit remind me not to stray. Enlighten my heart, O God, so that I can see the graveness of my sins and negligence, and have the will to obey Your commandments and live for the glory of Your holy name. Amen.",
        
        "Prayer Before Receiving Holy Communion (ST.Basil) \n\n O Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, our God, Fountain of immortality, Creator of all things visible and invisible, Consubstantial and Co-eternal Son of the eternal Father, who in Your exceedingly great love became incarnate in the latter days, and was crucified for us ungrateful and wicked children, and by Your own Blood renewed our nature corrupted by sin, O Immortal King, do receive me, a repentant sinner, incline Your ear toward me and hear my prayer. I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned against heaven and before You and am not worthy to lift up my eyes to the majesty of Your glory, for I have disrespected Your goodness and broken Your commandments, and disobeyed Your laws. But You, O Lord, most loving, long suffering, and merciful, have not given me over to perish in my sins, but do ever await my return. For, O You Who loves mankind, You have said by Your Prophet, You have no pleasure in the death of a sinner, but would rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live. You do not desire, O Master, to destroy the works of Your hands, nor that they should perish, but that all men should come to the knowledge of the Truth. Wherefore I, although unworthy both of heaven and of earth and of this temporary life, even I, a wretched sinner who had given myself over to every evil desire, do not despair of salvation, though I have been wholly subject to sin, a slave to passion and have defiled Your image within me, I who am Your creation and Your work; but trusting in Your infinite compassion I draw near unto You. Receive me O Lord, You Who love mankind, as You did receive the sinful woman, the thief, the tax collector and the prodigal son. Take away the heavy burden of my sins, You Who take away the sins of the world, and heal the infirmities of men, and call all that are weary and heavy laden to Yourself and give them rest. You Who did not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance, cleanse me from all stain of body and soul, and teach me to fulfill holiness in Your fear, that with the witness of my conscience pure, I may receive a portion of Your Father and Holy Spirit dwelling and abiding in me. And grant, O Lord Jesus Christ, my God, that the partaking of Your precious and Life-giving Mysteries may not be to my condemnation, nor may not through the weakness of my soul and body be received unworthily; but grant that even to my last breath, I may partake of a portion of Your Holy gifts without condemnation, unto the communion of Your Holy Spirit, as a preparation for eternal life and for a good defense at Your dreaded Judgment Seat, so that I, together with all Your elect, may also receive those incorruptible good things which You have prepared for them that love You, O Lord, in whom You are glorified forever. Amen.",
        
        "Prayer Before Receiving Holy Communion During EOTC Liturgy\n\n O my Lord Jesus Christ, I am unworthy of your coming under the roof of my impure house, for I have let you down, and have done evil in your sight. I desecrated my soul and body by my transgressions even though I was created in your image and likeness. I have no good works whatsoever. Even so, for the sake of me being Your creation, and for the sake of Your incarnation for my salvation, for the sake of your crucifixion on the honored cross, for the sake of Your life giving death and for the sake of Your resurrection on the third day; I pray to you and beseech you my Lord, that you purify me from all guilt and curse, and from sin and defilement. O! You, life of the world, When I do receive now Your Holy Mystery, let it not be for judgement nor for condemnation, rather have compassion on me, forgive me; and through it grant me remission of my sin and life for my soul. Through the intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Mary of twofold Virginity Your mother, and of John the Baptist, and through the prayer of all the holy angels and all the martyrs and righteous who have fought the good fight, world without end Amen.",
        
        "Prayer After Receiving Holy Communion (ST. Basil)\n\n O my Lord, and my God Jesus Christ, behold I have received Your Holy body and Your precious Blood. Let it be for the remission of my sins and the blotting out of my trespasses. O! the only begotten Son and lover of man, fill my mouth with your praise that I may praise your glory, for You are He who before time became man and revealed Yourself through Your incarnation in order to save me forever, You redeemed me forever for the sake of Your holy name. Glory be to you, O! my Lord and my God Jesus Christ, who granted me Your Body and Blood at the hands of Your servant. I glorify You and pray to You that I maybe one with Your flock and that You count me with Your sheep and accept me. Again remember not my trespasses. I give thanks to Your grace which has been granted to me and Your deliverance which has been with me Amen.",
        
        "Prayer After Receiving Holy Communion (St. John Chrysostom)\n\n O Lord my God, I know that I am not worthy nor sufficient that You should enter under my roof into the habitation of my soul, for it is all deserted and in ruins, and there is not a fitting place in me for You to lay Your head. But as from the heights of Your glory You humbled Yourself, so now bear me in my humility, as You deigned to lie in a manger in a cave, so deign now also to come into the manger of my mute soul and corrupt body. As You did not refrain from entering the house of Simon the leper, nor shrink from eating there with sinners so also vouchsafe to enter the house of my poor soul, all leprous and full of sin. You did not reject the sinful woman who ventured to draw near to touch You, so also have pity on me, a sinner, approaching to touch You and grant that I may partake of Your All-Holy Body and Precious Blood for sanctification, enlightenment and strengthening of my weak soul and body, for my preservation against all the snares of the devil, for victory over all my sinful habits, for the mortification of my passions, for obedience to Your Commandments, for growth in Your divine grace and inheritance of Your Kingdom. For it is not with a careless heart that I approach You. O Christ my God, but I come trusting in Your infinite goodness and fearing lest I may be drawn afar from You and become the prey of the wolf of souls. Wherefore, I pray You, O Master, Who alone are Holy, that You would sanctify my soul and body, my mind and heart and reins, and renew me entirely. Implant in my organs the fear of You, be my Helper and my Guide, directing my life in the paths of peace, and make me worthy to stand at Your right Hand with Your saints; through the prayers and intercessions of Your Immaculate Mother, of the bodiless Servitors, of the immaculate Powers, and of all the saints who from all ages have been well-pleasing to You.Amen."

        "Prayer of Esther \n\n O My Lord, You alone are our King.  Help me, who am alone and have no help but you! For my risk of danger is in my hand.  I have heard from my birth in the tribe of my family that you, O Lord, chose Israel our of all the nations, and our fathers out of all their ancestors, for an everlasting inheritance, and do for whatever You have spoken.  Now we sinned before You, and You have delivered us into the hand of our enemies because we have worshiped their gods.  O Lord, You are righteous.  But now they are not satisfied with the bitter state of our bondage, but they have pledged to their idols to abolish the decree You have spoken and to destroy Your inheritance, to close the mouths of those who praise You and to extinguish the glory of Your temple and Your altar, and to open the mouths of the heathen to proclaim the virtues of their false gods and to extol a human king forever.\n O Lord, do not give Your scepter over to those who are not.  Do not let them laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel against themselves, and make an example of the one who rules against us.  Remember us, O Lord, Manifest Yourself in the time of our affliction, and encourage me, O King of gods and ruler over every power.  Grant to my mouth proper words in the presence of the lion, to turn his heart to a hatred of our enemy, so that he and those agreeing with him may perish.  Save us by Your hand, and help me who am alone and have no one but You, O Lord.\n You know all things, and You know I hate the glory of the lawless and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised and of every foreigner.  You know my necessity, for I abhor the symbol of my proud station which is upon my head on the days when I appear in public, as if it were a menstrual rag, and I do not wear it on the days I am alone.  Your handmaid has not eaten at the table of Haman, nor have I honored the banquet of the king, nor drunk the wine of libations.  Neither has Your handmaid rejoiced since the day of her elevation, except in You, O Lord, God of Abraham. O God who have power over all, hear the voice of us in despair, and deliver us from the hand of those acting wickedly, and deliver me from my fear. ",
        
        "Prayer Of Manasseh\n\n Lord Almighty, God of our ancestors, God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their righteous children, you made heaven and earth with all their beauty. You set limits for the sea by speaking your command. You closed the bottomless pit, and sealed it by your powerful and glorious name. All things fear you and tremble in your presence, because no one can endure the brightness of your glory. No one can resist the fury of your threat against sinners. But your promised mercies are beyond measure and imagination, because you are the highest, Lord, kind, patient, and merciful, and you feel sorry over human troubles You, Lord, according to your gentle grace, promised forgiveness to those who are sorry for their sins. In your great mercy, you allowed sinners to turn from their sins and find salvation. Therefore, Lord, God of those who do what is right, you didn’t offer Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who didn’t sin against you, a chance to change their hearts and lives. But you offer me, the sinner, the chance to change my heart and life, because my sins out numbered the grains of sand by the sea. My sins are many, Lord; they are many.I am not worthy to look up,to gaze into heaven because of my many sins.Now, Lord, I suffer justly.I deserve the troubles I encounter.Already I’m caught in a trap.I’m held down by iron chains so that I can’t lift up my head because of my sins.There’s no relief for me,because I made you angry,doing wrong in front of your face,setting up false gods and committing offenses.Now I bow down before you from deep within my heart,begging for your kindness.I have sinned, Lord, I have sinned,and I know the laws I’ve broken.I’m praying, begging you:Forgive me, Lord, forgive me.Don’t destroy me along with my sins.Don’t keep my bad deeds in your memory forever.Don’t sentence me to the earth’s depths,for you, Lord, are the God of those who turn from their sins.In me you’ll show how kind you are.Although I’m not worthy, you’ll save me according to your great mercy.I will praise you continuously all the days of my life, because all of heaven’s forces praise you,and the glory is yours forever and always.

        "Prayer of Hannah\n\n “My heart rejoices in the Lord;in the Lord my horn is lifted high.My mouth boasts over my enemies,for I delight in your deliverance.“There is no one Holy like the Lord;there is no one besides you;there is no Rock like our God.“Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance,for the Lord is a God who knows,and by him deeds are weighed.“The bows of the warriors are broken,but those who stumbled are armed with strength.Those who were full hire themselves out for food,but those who were hungry are hungry no more.She who was barren has borne seven children,but she who has had many sons pines away.“The Lord brings death and makes alive;he brings down to the grave and raises up.The Lord sends poverty and wealth;he humbles and he exalts.He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. “For the foundations of the earth are the Lord’s; on them he has set the world. He will guard the feet of his faithful servants, but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness. “It is not by strength that one prevails;those who oppose the Lord will be broken.The Most High will thunder from heaven;the Lord will judge the ends of the earth.“He will give strength to his kingand exalt the horn of his anointed.”",
        
        "Prayer Of The Three Children\n\n  “Blessed are you, O Lord, God of our ancestors, and worthy of praise; and glorious is Your name forever!  For you are just in all You have done; all Your works are true and Your ways right, and all Your judgments are true. You have executed true judgments in all You have brought upon us and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our ancestors; by a true judgment You have brought all this upon us because of our sins. For we have sinned and broken Your law in turning away from You; in all matters we have sinned grievously. We have not obeyed Your commandments, we have not kept them or done what You have commanded us for our own good. So all that You have brought upon us, and all that You have done to us, You have done by a true judgment.  You have handed us over to our enemies, lawless and hateful rebels, and to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the world. And now we cannot open our mouths; we, Your servants who worship you, have become a shame and a reproach. For Your name’s sake do not give us up forever, and do not annul Your covenant. Do not withdraw Your mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham your beloved and for the sake of Your servant Isaac and Israel Your holy one, to whom You promised to multiply their descendants like the stars of heaven and like the sand on the shore of the sea. For we, O Lord, have become fewer than any other nation, and are brought low this day in all the world because of our sins. In our day we have no ruler, or prophet, or leader, no burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, no place to make an offering before You and to find mercy. Yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be accepted, as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls, or with tens of thousands of fat lambs; such may our sacrifice be in Your sight today, and may we unreservedly follow You, for no shame will come to those who trust in You. And now with all our heart we follow You; we fear You and seek Your presence. Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in Your patience and in Your abundant mercy.  Deliver us in accordance with Your marvelous works, and bring glory to Your name, O Lord. Let all who do harm to Your servants be put to shame; let them be disgraced and deprived of all power, and let their strength be broken. Let them know that You alone are the Lord God, glorious over the whole world.”",

        Monday\n\n\n\nThe Lord desired to set Adam free, who was saddened and sorrowful at heart, and to bring him back to his former throne.

        "Thursday\n\nThe spotless Virgin Mary resembles the burning bush that Moses saw in the desert where the leaves of the bush was not burnt. Even when the Word of God became man through her, His Divinity did not consume her and her virginity continued intact after giving birth. His humanity was also not altered because of His Divinity; for He is the true God, our God, who came down to save us. Pray for us, O! the Holy One!\n\nHow wondrous is what took place in the Virgin's womb, who gave birth to God without the seed of man? The angel who appeared to Joseph testified joyfully saying \"He, who will be born from her with the work of the Holy Spirit, is the Word of God who became man without alteration.\" The Virgin Mary gave birth to Him who is far more greater joy for the world. The angel said to her \"you will give birth to a Son and He will be called Emmanuel,\" which means God is with us. Also He will be called Jesus, for He will save His people from their sin. Glory be to Him forever, whom we actually know is God but became man to deliver us with His mighty work and erase our sins. How amazing is His incarnation from this special Virgin? And she bound the Word of God. He neither required the seed of man for His birth nor was Her virginity altered for His birth. The Word of God is begotten from God the Father without any weariness and born without pain from the Virgin. The wise men worshiped Him and brought Him incense for He is God; they brought Him gold for He is eternal King, and they brought Him myrrh for His life-giving death that He accepted willingly. He is the only one who is compassionate and lover of mankind. Pray for us, O! the Holy One!\n\nHow amazing it is to take one rib from Adam's side and create the woman and all the generations after? Then the Lord, the Word of God is given to us. He was named Emmanuel after being born of the Virgin. Therefore, let us ask Her to plead for us from Her beloved Son. She is compassionate in the eyes of the Saints and the Bishops; for she gave birth to the One whom they implore. And for the prophets, she gave birth to the One whom they prophesied about. And for the apostles, she gave birth to the One whom they preached in His name to the ends of the world. And for martyrs and believers, who died for His name; she gave birth to Jesus Christ, whose wisdom of grace cannot be measured. Let us then contemplate on His level of mercy for He came to save us. Pray for us, O! the Holy One!\n\nThe Lord swore an oath to David, a sure oath that he will not revoke, saying \"Out of your own descendants, I will place on your throne.\" And God doesn't regret saying this. David himself, the righteous, when he believed that Christ is going to be born in flesh from his descendants, he wanted to find the place of birth for the Word of God. Then he did the search diligently and prophesied saying \"We heard Him in Ephrata.\" This is the dwelling place of the God of Jacob that Emmanuel chose to be born in the flesh to save us. And again, one of the prophets Micah, said “But you, Ephrata part of Bethlehem, you are not small among the country of kings of Judah, out of you will come for my people, the Israelite, the one who will be ruler over Israel.\" How amazing is that the two prophets who collaborated and prophesied about Christ, who is due praise from now to eternity with His Father and the Holy Spirit? Pray for us, O! the Holy One!\n\nWhen David's enemies revolted against him, who was the king of Israel, he wished to drink fountain water from Bethlehem. Then his captains quickly got up, fought through his enemies' camp and brought him what he wished to drink. And when David saw how they gave up their life boldly for him, he spilled the water and didn't drink from it. And that is counted as righteousness for him. Martyrs ignored the pleasures of this world, spilled their blood for the sake of God, and endured the bitterness of death for the sake of heavenly kingdom. According to the greatness of Your compassion, have mercy on us. Pray for us, O! the Holy One!\n\nOne of the Triune God, God the Son, came down from heaven and became humble for us. Seeing how disgraced we became, He dwelt in the womb of the Virgin. He became everything we are except being corrupt by sin. As the prophets prophesied, He was born in Bethlehem and made us His own people. Pray for us, O! the Holy One!\n\nWe all exalt you our Lady who gave birth to God, for your compassionate prayer is for all of us.\n\nWhen Eve rebelled and ate the fruit and our nature become subjected to the original sin, the Virgin Mary became the pride of us all by giving birth to God, who erased our curse. The Garden of Eden was shut because of Eve. But it is reopened through the Virgin Mary, for Her Son granted us to eat the tree of life, which is the Holy Body and Precious Blood of Christ - who saved all mankind out of His love. Who can fully understand about this marvelous mystery that we talk about her?\n\nWhat kind of mouth can explain? And what kind of ear hear? The One and only God, the lover of mankind, who was there before the creation of the world, the Son of God the Father, came down and became man from His holy Mother without changing His Divinity. Her Virginity is unaltered after she gave birth. And for that, it is known that she gave birth to God. How vast and deep is God's wisdom. A womb that is predestined to a painful childbearing became the source of eternal life. Without the seed of man, she gave birth to Him. Therefore, let us praise Him saying \"O! the lover of mankind, all glory is due to you for you are compassionate and savior of our humanity.\" Pray for us, O! the Holy One!",

You will bear Him who cannot be born, and will contain Him who cannot be contained in any measure.\" O! you who are full of grace and honor, you will be praised in many ways with an absolute honor for you became the dwelling place of the Word of God the Father. You are the large tent that gathers believers in Christ and who teaches them to worship the Holy Trinity. You are the one who conceived the pillar of fire that Moses saw, who was the Son of God that dwelt in your womb. You became the dwelling place for the Lord who created heaven and earth.\n\nYou carried Him in your womb for nine months. You are faithful to the one whom heaven and earth cannot confine. You became a ladder for us to ascend from earth to heaven. Your brightness shine more than the sun. Your womb is the eastern horizon who brought us the star that the righteous gazed at joyfully. That same womb was what the Lord cursed to give birth in pain and agony through Eve. But you, Virgin Mary, you heard the voice saying \"rejoice who is full of grace\" and you gave birth to the King and ruler of all creations, who came to salvage us. Therefore, we praise you as the angel Gabriel said, saying \"Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Rejoice, O! you who is full of grace, God is with you.\" Pray for us, O! the Holy One!",
        
        "Saturday\n\nShe, who held the Lord in the palms of her hand, is pure, illuminated and holy in every way. All creations joyfully cry out saying, Pray for us, O! the Holy One!\n\n\"Rejoice, O!
